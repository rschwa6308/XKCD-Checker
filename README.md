# XKCD-Checker
Simple python script to check for new XKCD comic and What-If

Create a shortcut to the '.pyw' file and place the shortcut in your startup folder.  The program will run silently (no cmd prompt) upon startup.  A new comic/What-If will result in a Windows 10 Desktop notification with the new comic/What-If title.

Requires 'urllib' for fetching webpage data.
Requires 'win10toast' for generating win10 notifications.
